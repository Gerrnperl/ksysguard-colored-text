# Ksysguard Colored Text

## Overview 

This project provides a display style for Ksysguard, featuring basic data text and a bar graph that represents data percentages. The text and bars utilize gradient colors based on the data values.

Primarily designed as a sensor widget style for the **Plasma Panel**, this display style aims to offer users a clear and compact way to visualize sensor data. And this sensor style may not be suitable for use in system monitor.

## Installation

This sensor face can be installed directly from the KDE Plasma System Monitor. Alternatively, you can manually install it by following these steps:

1. Download the appropriate display style from the [releases](https://www.pling.com/p/1972690/) page or clone this repository.
   - For plasma 5.x, download the `+plasma5` version.
   - For plasma 6.x, download the `+plasma6` version or switch to the `plasma6` branch.
2. Extract the downloaded file to `~/.local/share/ksysguard/sensorfaces/org.gerrnperl.text/`
3. Restart the `Plasma shell` and `Plasma systemmonitors` for the changes to take effect.
